/**
 * PURPOSE: Barrel export file for routes
 * 
 * LOGIC:
 * - Export AppRoutes, AuthRoutes, ProtectedRoutes from single file
 * - Allows importing multiple route components from one location
 * - Simplifies imports in other files
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * import { AppRoutes, AuthRoutes } from './routes';
 * Instead of separate imports from each file
